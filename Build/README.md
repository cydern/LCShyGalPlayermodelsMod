# ShyGal Playermodels v1.0.2
### The Definitive ShyGal Mod for Lethal Company!
This mod adds a variety of ShyGal models to your ship's suit rack with the intention of being as optimized and seamless as possible. I started the project after trying on different ShyGal mods that didn't feel functional, or especially "proportionally appropriate", and after satisfying results I've decided to publish the mod. It's certainly not perfect, but hopefully it'll soar for future updates.

Despite being past V1.0.0, this is still in development! Things are likely to have trouble working or have skewed functionality, my bad for the confusion. I'll continue updating for as long as I can! Please check out the "Known Issues" box below to help better understand where the mod is in development currently.

### Features
  - 9 Different Variants, each with a different color and personality
  - Expressions while emoting or after death
  - Supports expressions for emotes from the TooManyEmotes mod! (Only a select few, more in future updates)

### Original Model By CryptiaCurves, check it out!: https://cryptiacurves.itch.io/customizable-shygal-3d-models
  Disclaimer, while the original model was designed to be 18+, I have gladly put in the work to edit the meshes and textures to keep everything SFW :)

    Known Issues
      - Having TooManyEmotes installed can get expressions stuck due to ModelReplacementAPI not returning a 0 when it should.
      - Model's arms aren't accurate which can cause some weird poses on certain movements, like the point emote
      - Ragdoll on death is incredibly wooden and can get stuck easily, causing some weird visual heckery
    Todo
      - Try to add host control over config
      - Make better functionality for TooManyEmotes
